Some code requires GPML (Gaussian Processes for Machine Learning) 

GPML has a BSD-license. It can be downloaded from:
http://www.gaussianprocess.org/gpml/code/matlab/doc/
or
http://mloss.org/software/view/263/

spiketrainlib is developed to work with v3.1 (2010-09-28)
We provide covStkernel, and meanStkernelCount to interface spike train kernels
into GPML.

Run startup in gpml MATLAB package to add it to path.
